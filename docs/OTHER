Helping companies to get the Perl community be involved in their open source product.
If your company is releasing some software as open source one of the benefits of this is
to get more people involved in the development of the product. In many cases this failed.
See for example the case of Symbian that Nokia release as open source but then reverted this
step as they have not managed to build the development community around the product.

Building such community is not easy and not guaranteed. We can try to help in that.
