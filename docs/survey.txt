The result of the TPF survey from 2010 can be found here: http://survey.perlfoundation.org/Data-PerlSurvey-2010/R/
Several blog posts about the survey can be found here:

According to these blog entries TPF intends to run this survey every 2-3 years while we think 
it would be important to run such survey more often and to include more question in
the survey.
That will help us understand both how the Perl community is changing, where people who have 
left the Perl community have gone and what people who are not in the community see it.
We can also try to reach the wider Perl ecosystem. The people who use Perl very rarely 
or who are using the language but are not involved in the community.
