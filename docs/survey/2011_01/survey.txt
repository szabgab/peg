The result of the TPF survey from 2010 can be found here: http://survey.perlfoundation.org/Data-PerlSurvey-2010/R/
Several blog posts about the survey can be found here:

According to these blog entries TPF intends to run this survey every 2-3 years while we think 
it would be important to run such survey more often and to include more question in
the survey.
That will help us understand both how the Perl community is changing, where people who have 
left the Perl community have gone and what people who are not in the community see it.
We can also try to reach the wider Perl ecosystem. The people who use Perl very rarely 
or who are using the language but are not involved in the community.

We should try to understand the behavior of people in the "perl community" and in the industry and
see the differences.
So for every question ask for an answer regarding open source projects and corporate projects.
What kind of OOP are you using?
Do you use Perl::Critic? 
Do you write test using the Test::* framework?

How people are using Perl and other open source software
How people participate in and perceive open source software

How people who are not using perl perceive it?

*) Ask questions on topics that were left out from the TPF survey
   including Perl 6 related questions
*) Try to measure the difference in coding standards and practices
    between open source coding and corporate coding
*) Try to find out what things people who are not in the active Perl
    Community miss from the Perl ecosystem
*) Try to find out what would bring more people to contribute to the
   Perl Community (code, tests, docs, design etc).
*) Establish a base-line for us in the above metrics
*) See if there were any changes since the TPF survey in the metrics
   that are common.
